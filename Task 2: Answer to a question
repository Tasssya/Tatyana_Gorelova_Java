Task:

Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]]
Can this sequence be considered correct?
If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct?

-----------------

Answer:

The bracket sequence [((())()(())]] is incorrect.
The number of opening brackets must be equal to the number of closing brackets.

Number of opening square brackets: 1
Number of closing square brackets: 2

Number of opening round brackets: 6
Number of closing round brackets: 5

Some options for how the sequence can be fixed:
1.Increase the number of opening square brackets and number of closing round brackets:

[[((()))()(())]]

2.Reduce the number of closing square brackets and opening round brackets

[(())()(())]
